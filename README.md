# Python Visualization of Titanic Data

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn on the Titanic dataset. The visualizations provide insights into the survival rate, passenger demographics, and various relationships between the dataset's features.

## What it does

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the Titanic dataset from Seaborn library
2. Cleans and preprocesses the data
3. Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Visualizes the data using different types of charts, including:
    - Histogram (Age distribution of passengers)
    - Pie chart (Proportion of passengers by class)
    - Bar chart (Survival rate by passenger class)
    - Scatter plot (Fare vs. Age, colored by survival status)
    - Count plot (Survival count by gender)
    - Box plot (Age distribution by class and survival status)

## Prerequisites

- Python
